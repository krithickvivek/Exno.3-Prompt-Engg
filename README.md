# Exno.3-Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
# Aim: 
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.
# Algorithm:

## 1. Straightforward Prompts
- **Definition:**  
  A simple and direct instruction to the AI to perform a task without additional context or complex formatting.

- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:** "Write a short paragraph about the benefits of AI in healthcare."  
  **Output:**  
  AI in healthcare improves diagnosis accuracy, predicts disease risks, and automates administrative tasks, leading to better patient care and reduced workload for medical professionals.


## 2. Tabular Format Prompting
- **Definition:**  
  The AI is asked to provide information in a structured table format for clarity and easy comparison.

- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:** "List three types of machine learning with their description and real-world applications in a table."  
  **Output:**  

  | Type           | Description                                         | Real-World Application       |
  |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
  | Supervised     | Trains on labeled data to make predictions          | Spam detection in emails     |
  | Unsupervised   | Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data             | Customer segmentation        |
  | Reinforcement  | Learns via trial-and-error using rewards/penalties  | Robot navigation and control |

## 3. Missing Word Prompting
- **Definition:**  
  A sentence or statement is given with a missing word, and the AI is tasked to fill in the blank.

- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:** "Artificial Intelligence helps in ___ data patterns for decision-making."  
  **Output:**  
  Artificial Intelligence helps in analyzing data patterns for decision-making.
  
## 4. Preceding Question Prompting
- **Definition:**  
  A follow-up question is asked based on a previously provided context or question to ensure continuity.

- **Example:**  
  **Prompt:**  
  - First question: "What is Natural Language Processing?"  
  - Follow-up (preceding) question: "How is it used in chatbots?"  
  **Output:**  
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows chatbots to understand and respond to human language by processing text and speech inputs accurately.



# Result:
The experiment successfully demonstrated the use of various prompting techniques—Straightforward, Tabular Format, Missing Word, and Preceding Question Prompting—to guide AI responses effectively. These techniques enable structured, context-aware, and user-friendly interactions, forming a strong foundation for developing intelligent chatbot systems.
